# Aether X6100 Control

A project to make an interface library between the radio's STM32 base controller
and user-space applications.

Now part of the [Aether-Radio project](https://github.com/AetherRadio).

## Credits

The original project belongs to [Oleg Belousov](https://github.com/strijar).

Most of the information present reverse was obtained from reverse-engineering
the Xiegu X6100's front end app, called `x6100_ui_v100`. Credits go to Jet Yee,
the original software developer, and the only software developer at Xiegu from
what we know.
