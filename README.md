# X6100 Control Interface

I really want to work on the firmware for the transceiver Xiegu X6100. 
I even turned to the developers with a request to open the source.
I didn't get any response from them at all.
So I took matters into my own hands!

All the information I got was obtained from the app x6100_ui_v100.
